This all-in-one camera harnesses the expanse of its panoramic view to track targets and detect details in the monitored scene. The bullet camera combines 4 sensors that work in tandem to realize 180¡ã panoramic surveillance. It has a large aperture lens that leverages  flowing light technology to detect targets even in poor lighting, and supports image correction and editing video recordings on the platform.The PTZ camera cooperates with the bullet camera to perform smart tracking and quickly detect details in the monitored scene.  Advanced algorithms are integrated into the functions of the Bullet camera and PTZ camera, allowing them to perform detection and trigger a variety of alarms such as tripwire, intrusion, illegal parking in-area density. The PTZ camera can also be set to automatically or manually track targets, allowing the all-in-one camera to meet the security needs of complex scenes.

This all-in-one camera harnesses the expanse of its panoramic view to track targets and detect details in the monitored scene. The bullet camera combines 8 sensors that work in tandem to realize 360¡ã panoramic surveillance. It has a large aperture lens that leverages  flowing light technology to detect targets even in poor lighting, and supports image correction and editing video recordings on the platform.The PTZ camera cooperates with the bullet camera to perform smart tracking and quickly detect details in the monitored scene.  Advanced algorithms are integrated into the functions of the Bullet camera and PTZ camera, allowing them to perform detection and trigger a variety of alarms such as tripwire, intrusion, illegal parking in-area density. The PTZ camera can also be set to automatically or manually track targets, allowing the all-in-one camera to meet the security needs of complex scenes.
